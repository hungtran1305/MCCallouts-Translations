    <Caller>
        <Dialogue>Hello, are you the one who called in the burning trash?</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>Yes, that's me. I wanted to report a suspicious person I saw.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>I was walking past the trash can when I saw a person walking away.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>Right after that the fire started to burn!</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>This sounds suspicious, do you have details on the suspect?</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>Sure, it was a {gender} and around {age} years old.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>I was able to take a photo, here it is!</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>Thanks, we're looking for the suspect now. Bye!</Dialogue>

    <Evidence>
        <Dialogue>A Molotov cocktail, this was no accident... someone wanted to start a fire.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>A jerrycan full of gasoline, looks like someone was preparing to ignite something.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>A bong? Strange... maybe someone was too high to notice the fire they started.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>A frag grenade. This is no simple fire, we're dealing with something far more dangerous.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>A smoke grenade. Could have been used to cover up their tracks before setting the fire.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>A broken bottle. It seems improvised, but it could have been used to start the fire.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>A gas cylinder. If this went off, the whole area could've gone up in flames.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>An oil drum. It's leaking... and highly flammable. Looks like someone wanted to spread the fire.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>A petrol can. Smells like gasoline... someone really wanted to burn this place down.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>A sock? Well, it might not seem like much, but it smells bad enough to be a fire hazard.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>Typical. Somebody threw a burning cigarette in the trash, then it started igniting.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>A sock? Well, it might not seem like much, but it smells bad enough to be a fire hazard.</Dialogue>
