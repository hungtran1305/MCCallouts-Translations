        <Dialogue>Hello Officer! Thanks for coming! We have a very important delivery!</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>The armoured bank truck will deliver a big amount of money to our destination.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>The truck will be driven by you, a armoured swat vehicle will follow.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>We got reports that an attack might be happening, that's why we have you and the swat team. Let's go!</Dialogue>

        <Dialogue>Hello! I see you made it out alive! Now you know why we hire professionals like you, not like ... my colleagues.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>... definitely. At least the swat vehicle is bullet proof.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>The money truck is armoured, too. Only the windows are not.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>Here is the case.</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>Perfect, thank you, I put in a good word for you!</Dialogue>
        <Dialogue>I hope the risk was worth it, have a nice day!</Dialogue>
